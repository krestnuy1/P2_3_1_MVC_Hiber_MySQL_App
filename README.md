Task:
Let's move on to creating a working web application. All key points have been covered in the previous tasks. Now, you need to combine and link them into one project.
Using the work done on MVC and Hibernate, build a CRUD application.

Requirements:

Write a CRUD application using Spring MVC + Hibernate.
Create a User class with arbitrary fields (id, name, etc.).
The application should have a page that displays all users with the ability to add, delete, and modify users.
Configure Spring using JavaConfig and annotations, similar to previous projects. Avoid using XML. Without Spring Boot.
Modify the configuration to work with a database. Instead of using SessionFactory, use EntityManager.
(Note: "JavaConfig" refers to configuring Spring beans using Java code instead of XML.)
